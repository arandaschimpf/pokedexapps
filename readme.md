## Pokedex is here â†“

[DylanRoth5/Pokedexex](https://github.com/DylanRoth5/Pokedexex)

I could not get the pull to work and also could not get the svelte app to show the pokemons for some reason, plus there is a bug when i open `.svelte` files on vscode that it shows as if there's an error but they work just fine.

Finished the Vite + React app!ðŸŽ‰ But unfortunately the client stopped working for no reason maybe i changed something but i can't find what it is ðŸ˜µ.

The plan is get back to work on these on the weekend since i have a lot to cach up to this week on other subjects ðŸ˜©.

## How to Run
1. `cd server`
2. Run server: `npm run dev`
3. cd to the frontend you want to try: `Client/React/Svelte`
4. Run front-end: `npm run dev`

Hope you have a Good Day! ðŸ˜Š
